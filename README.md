## the big picture.

My formal education is in mechanical engineering. But, after a few years in the â€˜real worldâ€™ I realized that what I wanted to do was in the IT (Information Technology) world. I began working as a computer tech, moved to systems administration and then on to programming.

I started working independently in 2002, after working for the previous five years as a contractor. As a contractor I worked with Lucent Technologies, IBM, Edward Jones, BJC Health Systems and Anheuser Busch. In early 2002, I realized I could offer the same service at a much better rate and began working as an independent consultant.

## today.

Today, I continue to do what I love. My mission is to discover and create beautiful code for awesome projects.

My better days may involve diving into a React app, building an elegant interface with CSS/SASS, giving an app some awesome functionality with JavaScript/jQuery/Angular, building out the back-end of a web app with PHP, or creating a mobile app with Ionic and Cordova. Some days, I even get to do a little game development with the Unity3D Engine.

Additionally, I might:
- Whip up some Python code and dabble in some AI.
- Get my hands â€˜dirtyâ€™ building an IoT proof-of-concept device with an Arduino or Raspberry Pi board.
- Fill my brain with the latest technologies with classes from Udemy, Udacity, or another online training site.
- Spend some time working out or at the beach with a cold brew. :simple_smile:

I should also mention that I am a guru with WordPress. I have built my fair share of custom themes, plugins and widgets for WordPress.
